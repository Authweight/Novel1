Gala arc and themes
- Dialectic:
    - Thesis: It is her duty to throw herself at the most worthy cause she can find, even at great cost to herself
    - Antithesis: She ends up failing everyone she cares about and has no choice but to run away. The "cause" was pointless all along.
    - Synthesis: It's worth sacrificing for people she cares about. And you have to trust others. The risk is worth it, but don't be a fool.
- Grew up aristocratic, but learned how to live on her own without support
    - Needs to learn that her upbringing still echoes to her advantage even though she abandoned it
- Needs to move on from Andrea
    - Gala failed Andrea, abandoning her with a child to care for and no income
    - But also, more subtly, Andrea failed Gala. She cut Gala off and hated her for something she felt she had to do.
- Learning more about her powers
    - Gala can see the future, though right now it is mostly unconscious
    - By focusing, she can learn to see more clearly
- The old master
    - He is part of a tradition dating back from the fall of the Orthochron
    - He has been waiting in Bell Harbor for his next student
    - The time has come to go back in the open. Gala will open the way for a new dawn

Rolan arc and themes
- Dialectic:
    - Thesis: If you're good at something, do it. This will earn you praise and an easy life.
    - Antithesis: All you're good at is killing. Abandon it. Better to die in obscurity. Talent is a trap.
    - Synthesis: Learn to accept your gifts and use them wisely
- Mastery vs teaching
    - What makes a good teacher?
    - What does it mean to be good at something but not be able to explain why or how?
- Needs to learn that he is more than just a skilled pilot
- Leadership is difficult but necessary


Lore
- For 1,000 years, the Orthochron controlled the world
- Orthochron:
    - Monastic order
    - Organized hierarchically
    - Thousands of members
    - Run by a small, mysterious council of masters
    - Agents all over the world
    - Masters of futuresight and prophecy
- Their style of government was to rule with a very light touch. Each constituent state had considerable independence, in theory
- In practice, the Orthochron could make sure everything ran however they liked
    - Futuresight allowed agents to make small changes that rippled so as to manifest desired outcomes
- The Orthochron favored stability above all else. 
    - They saw a possibility, always on the horizon, for a nexus of change, past which they could not see
    - They called this the Obscura
    - They worked to keep that possibility at bay
- Eventually, a younger member of the Orthochron, Bay Willen, suggested the Obscura ought to be permitted to occur
    - He argued their intervention was unnatural and denied the world a necessary transformation
    - The others argued this was too risky. Everything could be destroyed
- Bay Willen ultimately brought about the fall of the Orthochron. He killed many of them and broke their power.
- This led to the Seventy Years' War, where powers rose and fell, struggling for supremacy
- Eventually the First Emperor emerged, conquering all others and founding the Empire
    - He conquered about 90% of the populated world
- After the First Emperor died, there were more wars
- Eventually, the empire controlled about 60% of the world population, concentrated in the core islands
- The rest of the world was divided into smaller nations with various complex relationships
- Starting in the empire and rippling out, the industrial revolution occurred, transforming the world drastically
- This eventually led to a brutal war, known as the Great War. The empire split in two with rival claimants to the throne.
- One side saw a collapse in government and the establishment of a republic
- An uneasy peace was established with substantial concessions by the new republic
- Current geopolitical situation:
    - The republic is smaller and weaker than the empire, but nobody wants another Great War
    - Many smaller island nations carefully balance the two major powers off each other in order to maintain their independence
    - The hot spots of the day are the southern islands
- Southern islands:
    - Never conquered by the First Emperor
    - Fiercely independent
    - Economically dynamic
    - Growing in size and importance to the world economy
    - Some islands were independent until the Great War, when they chose the wrong side and then were handed over by treaty
    - The unfree islands want independence so as to join the Free Islands
    - Formally, the Free Islands recognize these as rebels. But public opinion is sympathetic to them
    - A rebel force, funded partially by the Free Islands, and also by the Republic, is dedicated to achieving independence
- Rebels
    - Operate a network of secret bases on unpopulated islands
    - Maintain a fleet of warships scattered and hidden in the wide sea
    - Launch regular raids into imperial territory, disrupting imperial operations and causing trouble
- Division within rebels
    - The rebels are governed by a small council
    - Some want to pursue maximum aggression against the Empire
    - Maria, in particular, favors a less aggressive policy focused more on long-term capabilities and winning over the governments of the Southern Islands

How do the rebels work?
    - Committee for Southern Island Independence
    - Maintain significant ground, air, and sea forces
    - Hunted by imperials, but able to maintain force projection
    - They use ship camouflage to stay hidden from aircraft
    - Smaller ships wherever possible
    - Submarines
    - Hidden bases on uncharted islands
    - Night operations
    - Squadboat
        - A small carrier made from a converted cargo ship
        - Carries a single squadron of aircraft and associated support staff
        - Famously slow and vulnerable
    - Corvette
        - Surface ship workhorse
        - One big gun, machine guns, and torpedos
        - Tactics:
            - Close distance quickly
            - Attack from multiple directions
            - Avoid drastically heavier imperial ships
    -
